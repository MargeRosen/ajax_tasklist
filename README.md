# Task List #

Keep a task list to track things to do.

Check the box when a task is complete to move it to the completed task area.

Optionally, remove old completed tasks or remove incomplete tasks you no longer need.


### Run these commands to try it out. ###

```
bundle
rake db:setup
rails s
```

May need to run:

```
bundle update rails
```

Requires Ruby 1.9.2 or later to run.
